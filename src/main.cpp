/**
 * Title: Midterm 2
 * Description: Simulate a line at a coffee shop. Your simulation should run for 20 time periods (minutes) and display the current line at the coffee shop.
 * Author: Nick Galvez
 * Class: COMSC-210
 *
 */

// When the store opens (i.e. in first time period), add 5 customers to the line right away.

/**
In subsequent time periods, the probability of:

A customer being helped at the beginning of the line and ordering their coffee is 40%
A new customer joining the end of the line is 60%
The customer at the end of the line deciding they don't want to wait and leaving is 20%
Any particular customer can decide they don't want to wait and leave the line: 10%
A VIP (very important person) customer with a Coffee House Gold Card gets to skip the line and go straight to the counter and order: 10%


The status reporting should look like:

A customer joins the line:

Jean joined the line
A customer leaves the line before being served:

Jean left the line
A VIP customer joins the front of the line:

Jean (VIP) joins the front of the line
A customer is served:

Jean is served
The end customer gets frustrated and leaves the line:

Jean (at the rear) left the line
