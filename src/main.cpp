// Fully comment each instruction in the code, explaining what's happening on that particular line. 
// I want you to convince me that you understand what's happening with every pointer and line of code.

// Additionally, write a class method every_other_element() that will output the data structure starting with the first element, skip the second element, output the third, skip fourth, etc. Demo this method in your code.
